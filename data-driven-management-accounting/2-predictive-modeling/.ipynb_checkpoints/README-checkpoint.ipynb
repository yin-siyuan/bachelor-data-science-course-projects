    "# ü§ñ Predictive Modeling for Defect Detection in Bicycle Production\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a cost-sensitive decision tree classifier to detect high-risk customizations in GEAR‚Äôs bicycle assembly line. It balances inspection costs, repair costs, and customer lifetime value loss due to defects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Tools & Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python (scikit-learn, Pandas)\n",
    "- Decision tree classifier with hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Cost-benefit economic modeling\n",
    "- Feature importance and model interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ú® Key Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree model trained on 10,000 historical orders\n",
    "- Identification of key defect-driving configurations (e.g. frame, wheel, brake system)\n",
    "- Recommendation for using model-based inspections over random sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìà Business Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "By proactively identifying risky product combinations, GEAR can optimize its quality control procedures, reducing customer churn and defect-related costs.\n",
